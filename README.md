## How to use : 

0. If you haven't already, **[install dotnet 6.0 (x64)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)**
1. Put the images you want to use in the Images folder
2. Run the program (Colorpicker)
3. Write the name of the image you want to colorpick from INCLUDING FILE TYPE (ex : catpicture.jpg) (most image file types supported, idk which)
4. Write the name of the image you want to RECREATE with the colors from the first image INCLUDING FILE TYPE (ex : transflag.png) (most image file types supported, idk which)
5. Write the name of the output image WITHOUT FILE TYPE (ex : transflagfromcat)
6. Wait for the program to run
7. Your final image should appear in your images folder.
